                <ol>
                    <li>How does your portfolio show your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a CS, IS, or EMC student?
                        <p class="answer">My portfolio effectively demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by showcasing well-structured, visually appealing, and interactive web pages. As an Information Systems student, I focus on designing web solutions that enhance user experience while ensuring functionality and responsiveness. Through the use of HTML, I create structured and semantic content, while CSS helps in implementing modern, user-friendly designs. Additionally, I incorporate JavaScript to add dynamic features such as interactive forms, smooth animations, and real-time data updates. By integrating these technologies, my portfolio highlights my ability to develop functional and engaging web applications that align with both technical and business objectives in the IS field.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What projects, awards, and assignments highlight your progress in the program?
                        <p class="answer">Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that showcase my growth in web development and information systems. I have developed web-based applications that demonstrate my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies, ensuring that user interfaces are both functional and aesthetically appealing. My experience also includes creating database-driven web solutions, where I designed web pages that interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manage data effectively. Additionally, I have applied UI/UX design principles in my projects to improve usability and accessibility. Aside from coursework, I have participated in coding challenges, hackathons, and certification programs to further enhance my skills. These experiences illustrate my dedication to continuously improving my technical and problem-solving abilities while adapting to emerging trends in the industry.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>How does your portfolio creatively showcase your web programming knowledge and experiences?
                        <p class="answer">My portfolio is designed not just as a display of my projects but as an engaging interactive experience that highlights my technical skills and creativity. I ensure that it follows modern web design principles, making it fully responsive and accessible across different devices. To enhance user engagement, I implement dynamic JavaScript features such as animations, interactive elements, and seamless navigation. I also focus on consistency in branding, color schemes, and typography, ensuring that my portfolio reflects both my technical expertise and design sense. Additionally, I incorporate live project demos, allowing visitors to interact with my work in real time rather than just viewing static images. By integrating these elements, my portfolio not only demonstrates my knowledge in web development but also highlights my ability to create practical and user-centered digital solutions, which is essential in the field of Information Systems.</p>
